**When:** 2012-2014

**Contribution:** Solo Founder, Architect, Full Stack Engineer, System Administrator

**Description:** Author Alcove is a book discovery service. "Even if your best friend was a book critic he couldn't give you recommendations this good."

Book and author data is pulled in via an API. The site uses a variation of the item-item algorithm which was shown to have the best performance on this dataset. A few of the smaller details that make the web application shine are a full site search powered by Solr, infinite scroll, a streamlined account creation process, and a delightfully simple UI.

Stats tracking, conversion analysis, and lifecycle emails have been built into the project from the outset.

**More info:** An IPython notebook with website traffic analysis and notes on scaling and capacity planning is available. Visit the live site at authoralcove.com.
