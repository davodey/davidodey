<p class="three-col">There has never been a better time to be a web designer, it’s really exciting.  The web has finally evolved enough to do some pretty wicked things that are lightweight, and native to most browsers.  IE has finally been overthrown as the browser of choice, and mobile device use is skyrocketing, out selling desktop machines 3 to1. Designers have also realized that desktop experiences are not the same on mobile devices, and we can’t just re-purpose them, to fit the small screen.  A completely new approach must be taken, a mobile first approach.  You cant build a mobile first website from a pre-made template, or service.  You need to hire a qualified consultant.  Someone who can handle content strategy, user experience, and pays attention to the details.  
 If you are looking for this type of web designer, let me introduce myself.  I am a responsive web designer and front-end developer located in, Phoenix Arizona and yes it’s really hot here in the summer.   I have a strong passion for web standards, and create unique, awesome user experiences, that can be accessed on all devices.  I am not a template designer, I don’t design banner ads or graphics, and I choose my clients carefully.
