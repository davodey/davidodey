    <h3><a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a></h3>
    <p>Font Awesome is well, awesome. It is my go-to icon font library. If you're new to SVG and want start using SVG graphics today, icon fonts are the way to go. They have great browser support, are light weight, and easy to implement.</p>
