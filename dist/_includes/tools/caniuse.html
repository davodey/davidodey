    <h3><a href="http://caniuse.com">Can I Use</a></h3>
    <p>Have you ever decided not to use a new HTML or CSS feature because you were unsure about the browser support? I know I have. Can I Use can help. All you do is go to the website, <a href="www.caniuse.com">http://www.caniuse.com</a> type in the CSS
        or HTML feature you are thinking of using, and a table will populate with all the supported browsers. It will also tell you how supported a feature is and if you need to use a vendor prefix or not. </p>
