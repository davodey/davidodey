**When:** 2024

**Contribution:** Backend Developer, Architect

**Description:**  
I designed and built the backend infrastructure for Pearson Plus, facilitating user testing and validation processes that enabled executives to make data-driven decisions based on real user feedback. The system was designed to streamline prototype testing, ensuring that feature development aligned with actual user needs.

To support these efforts, I developed a custom microservice architecture using Node.js and REST APIs, allowing seamless data collection, analysis, and feedback loops from user interactions. This infrastructure enabled the validation of key product features before full-scale deployment.

In addition to backend infrastructure, I architected and implemented a custom microservice for eText conversion, responsible for parsing EPUB format books and storing their content in the database. This service functioned as a test harness for evaluating eText prototypes, allowing teams to rapidly iterate on digital textbook experiences.

By leveraging microservices, I ensured scalability, modularity, and maintainability, making it easier for the engineering team to integrate new features and expand the platform. The system's architecture played a crucial role in accelerating product validation cycles, allowing Pearson to refine and optimize the Pearson Plus experience with confidence.
