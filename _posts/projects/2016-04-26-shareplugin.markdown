**When:** 2016

**Contribution:** jQuery Plugin Developer

**Description:** I developed a lightweight jQuery plugin that creates social sharing buttons, adds social counts and adds total counts.  Its fully customizable and easy to use.

I created this plugin for a few reasons.  One I needed one for my upcoming blog, which I plan on launching this Summer.  Two, most of the social sharing plugins I found that were already developed were a bit complex or didnt have the features I was looking for.  I wanted social sharing buttons created automatically by adding a `data-url` attribute to the markup.  I also wanted the ability to add individual share counts for each button along with the total of share counts between all the buttons.  Lastly I wanted the ability to easily toggle these features.  On our blogroll I wanted the ability to only show the total number of shares between each link, not necessarily the buttons or individual counts.  On single posts however, I wanted the whole enchilada.
