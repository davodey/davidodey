Have you ever been working on project, when things go wrong, really quick?  Maybe you were working on a new feature for a site,  and you realize after its too late, that something got over written and you have no way of getting that code back.  This happens more than it should in teams, I know first hand.  This can cause wasted time and unnecessary frustration in development.  To prevent this I use a tool called Git.  Git is a local version control system, that will clone copies of your files locally and allow you to switch between these different files as you need to. If your using a MAC for your development Git is already installed, all you have to do is initate the system. You can get started below.
