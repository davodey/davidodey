**When:** 2020 - 2021

**Contribution:** Backend Developer, Architect

**Description:**  
I designed and built the backend infrastructure for our Pearson Plus MVP, facilitating user testing and validation processes that enabled executives to make data-driven decisions based on real user feedback. The system was designed to streamline prototype testing, ensuring that feature development aligned with actual user needs.

To support these efforts, I developed a custom microservice architecture using Node.js and REST APIs, allowing seamless data collection, analysis, and feedback loops from user interactions. This infrastructure enabled the validation of key product features before full-scale deployment.

In addition to backend infrastructure, I architected and implemented a custom microservice for eText conversion, responsible for parsing EPUB format books and storing their content in the database. This service functioned as a test harness for evaluating eText prototypes, allowing teams to rapidly iterate on digital textbook experiences.
