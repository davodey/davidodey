**When:** 2014-2015

**Contribution:** UX Designer / Front End Developer, Wordpress Theme Developer

**Description:** Motive Energy specializes in batteries and equipment for construction vehicles.  Originally they had an overseas agency build a website for them.  They liked the overall design of the site but there were some big problems with development.  The site was not responsive, so it was not optimized for phones or tablets, it was built entirely with images so it had no SEO value and there was no way for their team to edit the content.

After some consulting we decided that I’d build them a site, based off the design they provided, using Wordpress as the CMS – Content Management System.  I started off by re-coding the entire site, building new HTML and CSS.  Since they wanted a fairly quick turnaround, we used bootstrap help get us up and running quick.  Once the site looked great and responded well I converted the site into a custom Wordpress theme.  This gave me full control of how I wanted Wordpress to handle the site, removing any un-necessary widgets.  I designed a custom Wordpress admin area that matched their brand and made it easy for them to update their content.
