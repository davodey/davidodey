**When:** 2024

**Contribution:** Designer, Architect, Front & Backend Developer

**Description:**  
I worked closely with product owners to build the UI and backend for Pearson Advantage, an AI powered learning platform. My role focused on creating a seamless and scalable front end experience using React and Web Components, while also developing an Express backend that connects to Firebase for secure data storage and real time updates.

For the UI, I designed and developed a component based architecture that ensures a consistent and modular design across the platform. Using custom Web Components, I helped establish a scalable design system that supports future growth while maintaining performance and accessibility.

On the backend, I built an Express API that handles authentication, user progress tracking, and content delivery. By integrating Firebase, I ensured real time synchronization between users and their learning data while maintaining a secure and scalable infrastructure.
