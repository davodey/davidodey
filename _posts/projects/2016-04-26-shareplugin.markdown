**When:** 2024 - 2025

**Contribution:** Founder, Designer, and Developer

**Description:**  
I created Homework Pilot to empower parents in guiding their children through homework with ease. The app transforms any assignment into a personalized learning experience. Simply snap or upload a photo and AI generates step by step explanations in real time. With scan based AI assistance, interactive chat for follow up questions, and customizable learning modes, Homework Pilot adapts to different learning styles, making complex topics easier to understand.

To bring this vision to life, I initially built the app using React Native and Expo, allowing for rapid cross platform development and early user validation. After refining the core features and gathering valuable feedback, I transitioned Homework Pilot into a fully native iOS 18 application using Swift and Xcode. This shift unlocked faster performance, seamless system integration, and a smoother user experience.

Rebuilding the app in Swift required rewriting key components, optimizing OCR performance, and leveraging Appleâ€™s native modules to enhance response accuracy and speed. The transition significantly boosted app responsiveness, offline support, and system level capabilities, ensuring Homework Pilot delivers fast, reliable, and intelligent homework assistance whenever parents and students need it.
