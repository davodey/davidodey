    <p>Pattern Lab is a tool to help you build an atomic design system from the ground up. What is an atomic design system? In short, its a way to build your own custom bootstrap, using the markup you want to use. I am really new to using pattern lab, but
        so far i think its great, especially for larger scale projects. Ill post some links below so you can read more about it, and watch a talk by one of the founders Brad Frost.</p>
