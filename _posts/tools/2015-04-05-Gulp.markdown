Gulp is a build tool that runs on node.js, its main purpose is to automate tedious and time consuming tasks.  I use gulp.js to compile and minify my SASS, add vendor pre-fixes to my css, clean up and combine my javascript, and compress my images. The beauty of this, is it happens automatically when i type one command: $ gulp.
