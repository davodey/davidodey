**When:** 2012-2014

**Contribution:** UX Designer / Frontend Developer, Wordpress Theme Developer

**Description:** WRP Containers builds custom sized waste containers for Government agencies and private companies.  They have a wide variety of product designed in all shapes and sizes.

WRPC was one of my first clients and I built them a website back in 2007.  I had been discussing a potential update / refresh in 2012 and wanted to make the site optimized for mobile.  We were torn between a dedicated mobile site or a responsive site.  In 2012, responsive was fairly new and less adopted then a m.dot site. The project ultimately got pushed back a year, so we ended up going responsive.

We started the design process by address areas of concern of the original site.  We wanted the site to be responsive, but we also wanted it to be easy to update.  So we decided that after the markup was complete we would convert the site to a custom Wordpress theme.   In about 6 months we went from wire framed concept to a fully functional custom Wordpress site.
