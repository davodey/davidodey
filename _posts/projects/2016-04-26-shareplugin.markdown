**When:** 2024 - 2025

**Contribution:** Founder, Designer, and Lead Developer

**Description:**  
I designed and developed Homework Pilot, an AI-powered homework assistant that helps parents support their children's education. The app allows users to snap or upload a photo of a homework assignment and receive AI-driven, step-by-step explanations. It was built using Swift, OpenAI’s GPT API, and Firestore, integrating OCR (optical character recognition) to process assignments efficiently.

I created this app to solve a common challenge—parents struggling to assist their kids with homework while managing work and family life. Most existing solutions focus on direct student interaction, but Homework Pilot takes a different approach: helping parents become more effective guides in their child’s learning journey.

To achieve this, I implemented several key features. First, scan-based AI assistance, which allows users to take a picture of a problem and instantly receive structured explanations. Second, an interactive AI chat, enabling parents and students to ask follow-up questions in real time. Lastly, a customizable learning mode, allowing users to tailor explanations based on the child's learning style or subject difficulty.

Developing this application presented several challenges. Ensuring AI-generated responses were both accurate and easy to understand required building a context-aware adaptation layer that refines explanations dynamically. I also needed to optimize performance so that AI-generated results were delivered quickly and clearly, without overloading the mobile UI.

Future updates will expand the app’s capabilities, including voice-to-text support for hands-free interaction, expanded subject matter, and gamified learning modules to make homework assistance more engaging.
