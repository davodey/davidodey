		<em>A collection of useful sites that will help you level up your skills</em>
		<p>
			If youâ€™re new to web design or front-end development, you can quickly become overwhelmed, with the wide variety of tools, resources, and news sites, on the web.  Over the years I have collected a pretty good go-to list of sites I can visit on a regular basis, that help me level up my skills, keep me current with styles and techniques, and tools that have become vital, as part of my everyday workflow.  I want to share these with you, so you can become the  rock star designer / developer you want to be.
