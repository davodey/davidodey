    <p>I first heard of Sass last year while attending a CSS conference. I'll admit, I wasn't that excited to have to learn a new way to write CSS. It felt like one more thing to do. Luckily I heard a talk from @laurakalbag on the benefits of using Sass and how to incorporate it into your workflow. By the end of her talk, I was excited to try and learn this new language.  Since then, I use Sass on all my projects and encourage it on the teams I work on.  The ability to store and call variables, write functions, and nest css selectors is just Sasstastic, and its only a fraction of what you can actually do with this powerful language.</p>
