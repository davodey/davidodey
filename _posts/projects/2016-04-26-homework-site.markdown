**When:** 2025

**Contribution:** UX Designer, Front & Backend Developer

**Description:**  
I designed and developed the Homework Pilot marketing site to showcase the app’s features and provide a seamless user experience. The site was built with React for a fast and dynamic front end and powered by an Express back end with an admin system to track user analytics and engagement.

The design focuses on clarity and accessibility, using clean layouts, engaging visuals, and clear messaging to communicate the app’s value. The admin system allows me to monitor user interactions, track key metrics, and optimize marketing strategies based on real time data.

This platform serves as the gateway to Homework Pilot, ensuring a smooth introduction for new users while providing valuable insights to enhance the overall experience.
