**When:** 2024

**Contribution:** Designer, Architect, Developer

**Description:**  
I designed and developed Pearson Advantage, an AI-powered adaptive learning platform that delivers personalized education experiences tailored to individual learners. By leveraging adaptive learning technology, the platform dynamically adjusts course content based on user competence and confidence, allowing students to master subjects up to 2x faster than traditional learning methods.

The platform provides direct access to expert-curated IT courses, featuring officially endorsed content from Cisco, Microsoft, and industry thought leaders. Unlike other IT learning platforms with overwhelming course catalogs, Pearson Advantage curates only the highest-caliber courses, ensuring learners receive quality over quantity.
